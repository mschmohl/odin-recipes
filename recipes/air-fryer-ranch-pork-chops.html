    <h1>Air Fryer Ranch Pork Chops</h1>
    <img src="images/pork-chop.webp" alt="pork-chop">

    <p>What could be simpler than ranch seasoning mix and 10 minutes in the air fryer? I prefer my chops slightly pink
        to ensure juiciness, but feel free to add an extra minute on each side for well done. Try different varieties of
        ranch mix (like spicy or bacon) to change up the flavor.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 boneless, center-cut pork chops, 1-inch thick</li>
        <li>cooking spray </li>
        <li>2 teaspoons dry ranch salad dressing mix (such as Hidden Valley RanchÂ®)</li>
        <li>aluminum foil</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <h3>Step 1</h3>
    <p>Place pork chops on a plate and lightly spray both sides with cooking spray. Sprinkle both sides with ranch
        seasoning mix and let sit at room temperature for 10 minutes.</p>
    <h3>Step 2</h3>
    <p>Spray the basket of an air fryer with cooking spray and preheat the air fryer to 390 degrees F (200 degrees C).
    </p>
    <h3>Step 3</h3>
    <p>Place chops in the preheated air fryer, working in batches if necessary, to ensure fryer is not overcrowded.</p>
    <h3>Step 4</h3>
    <p>Cook for 5 minutes. Flip chops and cook 5 minutes more. Let rest on a foil-covered plate for 5 minutes before
        serving.</p>
    <h2>Cook's Note:</h2>
    <p>If you need to air fry in batches, keep cooked chops warm in an oven on the lowest setting while air frying
        remaining chops.</p>
    <p>For thicker chops, add an extra minute to the cook time. For thinner chops, cook 1 minute less.</p>
